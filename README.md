# Customer-Churn-Prediction

Churn prediction is one of the most popular Big Data use cases in business. Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, occurs when customers stop taking subscription to the services of a company. For banks it is very useful to know what leads a client towards the decision of leaving the company. Churn prevention allows companies to develop loyalty programs and retention campaigns to keep as many customers as possible.

## Objective
In this project, a simple customer churn prediction model is built using the Support Vector Machine (SVM). This is a classification project, since the variable to be predicted is binary (churn or loyal).

## Dataset
The dataset is taken from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/kmalit/bank-customer-churn-prediction/data">Bank Customer Churn Datset</a>. 

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and churn modelling can be found in the notebook.

## Result
The mean accuracy of the model is 0.848 on test data.
